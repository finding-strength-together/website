<p class= "story"> My story is filled with regret and sadness, I tried to do the right thing, but in the trauma of the moment, I had no idea what the right thing was. When my daughter was 11 years old, she revealed to my husband and I that her grandmother's boyfriend was molesting her. Our reaction was to remove her immediately from having anything to do with him. We never contacted the authorities. Our beautiful daughter had been traumatized enough. My mother in-law didn't see it that way, she called my daughter a liar. This destroyed the relationship my daughter had with her grandmother. I wanted distance from both the grandmother (my husband's mother) and her sexually abusive boyfriend. My husband refused. He wanted the family to heal together. This was going to include his mother's wishes. Against my better judgment, it was his mother and my daughter I needed to consider. They needed healing, but especially my daughter. They went to see the therapist to start the healing process. The therapist heard my daughter's accusations. She witnessed the evidence, and immediately called the police. The grandmother's boyfriend was arrested. My mother in-law was infuriated. She blamed me and my daughter, believing we knew if she went for therapy he would be arrested, which we did not....  </p>

<p class="story"> I was standing in line at the grocery store. As I waited, trying to total everything to see if I had enough money to buy diapers my phone rang. I had to answer it. He started yelling right away. Why wasn't I home. Where was dinner? He forgot that he didn't give me grocery money until this morning. Even then, it was only $75. How can I feed all of us on that? His steak takes up a huge piece of that. I wish this line would move quicker. I have to get home before the kids. It's better that way. Maybe I can suggest to my sister that she bring them to her house for a playdate. </p>

<p class="story"> I met my kids' father when I was 16 years old. We started dating and 3 years later I got pregnant. We were staying with family. I had my daugther and soon later I got my apartment. Everything was going ok until he started getting high and stopped working. I was on Welfare and I couldn't pay all the bills by myself. I started telling him to please find a job so he could help with the bills. Now the problems of abuse started. He started putting his hands on me by pushing me. Now I started going out with my sister and I got introduced to drugs not knowing that I was catching a habit. Now I ended up waking up sick not knowing that I was having withdrawals from the drug. I started using with him, but the abuse didn't stop it continued and each day it was getting worse. A year later I got pregnant again with my son and now I had two problems. I didn't want to lose my kids through DSS because I was using and pregnant. I went to the hospital looking for help and they did help me by putting me on methodone until I had my son and I got off it and I stayed clean. But the abuse didn't stop until one day he grabbed me by my neck and started choking me and I passed out on the floor. I thought that I was dying because I could't see anything or hear anything. I started to ask God to please help me, that I didn't want to die because I didn't want to leave my kids. I regained consciousness back and I got up from the floor and I called the police when he wasn't looking. I never went back to him. I'm happy now trying to have a life with my kids and grandkids. They are my world.
